### Algorithm approce:
1. Encoding  
1.1. Data padding. To fit the binary data onto the molecule, it must be divided by the molecule size and the block size. If the division results in a gap, the data is padded with zeros to close this gap.  
1.2. 2D-error correction using Reed-Solomon decoding. Reed Solomon (RS) is used a total of three times. It is applied lengthwise on each sequence twice, error correcting each barcode sequence and then each payload sequence. It is also used crosswise on all the sequences in one block size.   
2. Synthesis and sequencing.    
2.1. Simulating the synthesis process. The synthesis of each combinatorial sequence was simulated separately.
For a fixed sequence we first draw, from 𝑋`~`𝑁(𝜇 =predtermined, 𝜎^2 = 100), the number of molecules that will represent it. Let this number be x. All k-mers that occur within a single position (cycle) are then generated. To do this, x numbers of the subset are selected, representing the relevant 𝜎. The size of this 
subset is 𝐾, and its members will most likely be represented many times. This random composition is achieved by drawing a total of x independent times, according to 𝑌`~`𝑈(1,𝐾). 1s in 𝜎 are indexed at 1, …, 𝐾, and the appropriate k-mers are “synthesized” in accordance with the drawn index. 
2.2. Mixing. Once all of the molecules are synthesized, they are mixed to mimic real molecules in a container.  
2.3. Error simulation. To replicate a real synthesis and sequencing process, several error scenarios were simulated. These include the three error types Deletion, Insertion, and Substitution of a letter in the sequence, each predefined by an error percentage. A Bernoulli trial is then performed on every sequence and letter position, where 𝑃 is the predefined error, inserting the errors in each position. To replicate the Substitution error, we implemented the error per nucleotide, and for the Insertion and Deletions errors we implemented 
the error on each full k-mer. This method is closest to the expected error scenarios in combinatorial DNA synthesis and sequencing.  
2.4. Reading and sampling. Several different samples were drawn, to analyze their impact on the accuracy of 
the data retrieved.
3. Decoding  
3.1. Sequence retrieval. To retrieve the original sequence, first each sequence barcode undergoes RS error correction. Next, each sequence payload is reviewed individually, and undergoes RS, too. For sequences in the same block, RS is also done, crosswise on the block.  
3.2. Grouping by barcode and determining 𝝈 in each position. Once barcode retrieval is complete, sequences are grouped by the same barcode. In each of the groups, all the sequences are reviewed at the same exact position, where we extract the 𝐾 most common k-mers to determine the 𝜎 in that position. In the process of determining the 𝐾 most common k-mers, we may encounter invalid k-mer (not in Ω). Should an invalid k-mer be encountered in the payload sequence, the following steps are taken:  
• If the length of the sequence is equal to the predetermined length. The sequence is reviewed, and if an invalid k-mer is encountered, which is not part of our alphabet, an 𝑋𝑑𝑢𝑚𝑚𝑦 is inserted instead, followed by skipping 3nts.  
• If the length of the sequence is smaller than the predetermined length. When Δ<SL*, it indicates that there is a deletion in the sequence. We pad it with a dummy nucleotide 𝑅 that restores it to the predetermined length, and then review the sequence.   
• If the length of the sequence is greater than the predetermined length. When Δ>SL*, it indicates that there is an insertion in the sequence. We cut the sequence to restore it to the predetermined length, and then review the sequence.

3.3. Missing barcode. After the reading process is complete, if a barcode is found missing, the missing barcode and a dummy sequence is added to enable Reed Solomon to retrieve the data correctly.   
4. Validation  
4.1. Levenshtein distance. After recovering the data, the magnitude of the error in the information recovery process is reviewed, by assessing the Levenshtein distance between the input 𝐼 and output 𝑂.
